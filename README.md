My name is Cortland Watson and I am a psychology student at BYUI. This course is structured in such a way that we are able to work hard to understand concepts. It is the exact same way that BYU-Idaho has tried to structure all of their courses. We prepare, come with questions and work through our own problems.

--------------------------

My goal is to get caught up with all work by the 13th of March. I want to be able to complete all of the tasks for the class and complete 10 Case Studies. I feel like this goal allows me to be able to focus on what lays ahead of me for the case studies, and then get caught up on the tasks. Each week I will complete the case study, 3 tasks, and focus on doing at least 1hr of work each day, 3hrs each Saturday.
